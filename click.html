            <h3 class="display-10 text-light bg-dark">Jesus Christ gives salvation by grace through faith.</h3>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark">Your heart tends to run from God and rebel against Him. The Bible calls this "sin." <em>Romans 3:23 says, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."</em></p>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark">Yet God loves you and wants to save you from sin, to offer you a new life of hope. <em>John 10:10 says, "I have come that they may have life and have it in abundance."</em></p>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark">To give you this gift of salvation, God made a way through His Son, Jesus Christ. <em>Romans 5:8 says, "But God proves His own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."</em></p>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark">You receive this gift by faith alone. <em> Ephesians 2:8 says, "For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God's gift—not from works, so that no one can boast."</em></p>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark">Faith is a decision of your heart demonstrated by the actions of your life. <em>Romans 10:9 says, "If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."</em></p>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark">If you trust that Jesus died for your sins and to receive new life through Him, pray a prayer similar to this to express your repentance and faith in Him:</p>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark"><em>"Dear God, I know I am a sinner. I believe Jesus died to forgive me of my sins. I now accept Your offer of eternal life. Thank You for forgiving me of all my sin. Thank You for my new life. From this day forward, I will choose to follow You."</em></p>
